# Soul Urn

![Soul Urn](block:betterwithmods:urn@8)

For ingame guide:
The soul urn is a block created using the filtered hopper. Its purpose is to make soul forged steel. To make a soul urn, place a regular urn right under a filtered hopper (many people may confuse the bottom of the filtered hopper as the connection to a axle, though it can be any side!) and place a block of soul sand into the filtered hopper. Once you have done that take 8 ground netherrack and throw it into the filtered hopper. Once all 8 piles of ground netherack have been converted it will force the souls from the soul sand to move down into the urn. Creating a soul urn!
